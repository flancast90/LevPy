# Please Keep in mind that the JSONvar name must
# also be the same as the function that 
# contains more data on it in LevPy.py

# Valid JSON, names can be anything, with data after the
# colon. The name must match your calls for mainLoop
# in LevPy.py. See example for more detail

JSONvar = '{"":""}'
